Originally reated by OXEY (https://github.com/O-X-E-Y) and his great tools. Afterwards I refined it.
Version 5 is worked on, trying to organize the AltGr-Layer better.


How to use it:
Download whole folder.
Place it somewhere save.
Doubleclick the .exe
Reboot computer.

To remove:
Doubleclick the .exe again.

Best used with angle mod:
